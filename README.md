#### **EXERCISE A**
We must to create different files (.html .rtf .xml) with some example code. I thought it's a good idea to take real code, and took the original code of google at www.google.com. (Right button on the google page and select 'ver cÃ³digo fuente', select all and copy/paste to my files).  
Trying to open the 3 files, I could open the .html with Mozilla Firefox and see it normally, but without images. I opened the .rtf file witn Office Word, it shows its content, but it's messy and chaotic. When Itried to  open the .xml file it seems empty, doesn't shows anything.  

#### **EXERCISE B**
It's very easy. Register at https://github.com/, and put your files on your repository, only need to drop and drag.

#### **EXERCISE C**
Clicking on your .html file you open it. Copy the URL and paste it to https://rawgit.com/. Later, copy the 'URL for development' and paste it in a new window. If the URL open corrctly, it's ok.

#### **EXERCISE D**
_italic_
**bold**
**_both_**
